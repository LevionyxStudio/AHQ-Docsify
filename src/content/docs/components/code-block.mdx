# Code Block

Code blocks are automatically styled using `rehype-highlight`. You can use standard markdown syntax for code fences, and they will be beautifully highlighted.

## Usage

Just use standard markdown code fences with a language identifier.

```javascript
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

export function MyComponent() {
  return <Button>Click me</Button>
}
```

### With Title

You can add a title to a code block by adding `title="Your Title"` to the fence.

```javascript title="components/MyComponent.tsx"
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

export function MyComponent() {
  return <Button>Click me</Button>
}
```
